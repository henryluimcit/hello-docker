This project is to introduce Docker to Django projects

Tutorial to set up Docker with Django:

2. Build the Docker image using docker build .
3. Create a docker-compose.yml, which controls how to run the container
4. Run the Docker containuer using the command docker-compose up
5. Done!
6. Stop the container with Control+c, and type the command docker-compose down.  This frees up memory
